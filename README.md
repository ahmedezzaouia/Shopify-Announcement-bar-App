# Shopify Announcement bar App


if you’re looking for a way to share site-wide messages that can increase your conversion and engagement rates and ultimately influence your sales and leads. you should consider adding an announcement bar to your Shopify Store.

I've seen a lot of paid apps on Shopify App Store that add an announcement bar to the store. They are limited in terms of customization, For that, I built a new one with Shopify app Extension that allows merchants to easily edit The app in the store editor.

Here is what the My App include : 

✅ 21 backgrounds to use <br/>
✅ 40 most used icons <br/>
✅ Option to upload your own background images <br/>
✅ Everything is customizable: Button, Text, Fonts, Size… <br/>
